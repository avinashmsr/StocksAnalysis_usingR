# StocksAnalysis_usingR
The main objective of this project was to build various Machine Learning algorithms using R Language and R Studio that would help in predicting the price of a stock.
For example, stock data of Coca cola (ticker: KO) was taken from yahoo finance which is then fed as input to the various Maching Learning models built to analyze the stock price trends and predict the future price of the KO stock as accurately as possible. I built reusable functions as well.
I worked on this project during a course that I took during my Full-Time MBA with Business Analytics program at the University of Pittsburgh.
